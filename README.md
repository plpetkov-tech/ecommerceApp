# ecommerceApp

## This application features a fully working ecommerce site with backend and front-end

### With little modifications on the model you can reuse the whole backend and front end logic, as the app is leveraging Spring Data JPA , which generates you the APIs that will be called.

Complete steps are found in the steps.md file with the process of building this app, they are not a tutorial, just kind of directive when building it and to know the process followed, may be on some times that the process wasn't fully documented but this is the best I can do :)
